      <p id="quote"><i>“The quicker we all realize that we’ve been taught how to live life by the people that were operating on the momentum of an ignorant past
          the quicker we can move to a global ethic of community that doesn’t value
          invented borders or the monopolization of natural resources, but rather the
          goal of a happier more loving humanity." <br /><strong>--Joe Rogan</strong></i></p>
